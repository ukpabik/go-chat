# go-chat

`go-chat` is a TCP-based chat application built in Go, inspired by my interest in networks and Go programming. This project has been a great way to dive into Go, allowing me to explore client-server communication, concurrency, and socket programming.

## Project Goals

Iâ€™m looking to push this project further by learning and implementing:
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Adding secure login and access control.
- **Database Integrations**: Storing user data, message history, and more.
- **Enhanced Features**: Expanding message handling, error management, and scalability.

This is an ongoing project where each enhancement will deepen my understanding of network protocols, security, and backend development in Go.
