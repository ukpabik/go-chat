# go-chat

`go-chat` is a TCP-based chat application built in Go, inspired by my interest in networks and Go programming. This project has been a great way to dive into Go, allowing me to explore client-server communication, concurrency, and socket programming.

This is an **ongoing** project where each added feature will strengthen my understanding of network protocols, security, and backend development in Go.
